#### About this project: 
Just a code along based on the course: [modern react with redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/overview "modern react with redux"). It's web app built
with React.js/ Redux that utilizes the [OpenWeatherMapAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api/ "Open Weather Map API"). Type in an American city and press enter or click submit and watch the graphs for Temperature, Pressure and Humidity.

#### Technologies used: 
* **React.js** for making the nice UI.

* **CSS 3** for small design fixes.
